# Oche — Ralph Progress Log

## Codebase Patterns
- Use `npm run check` to run typecheck + tests before merging
- Tailwind CSS v4 uses `@import "tailwindcss"` in CSS (no directives like v3)
- Convex directory has its own tsconfig.json separate from the app
- Vitest uses jsdom environment with @testing-library/react for component tests
- Test setup file at `src/test-setup.ts` imports jest-dom matchers
- Mock Convex hooks with `vi.mock("convex/react", ...)` at module level
- Use `cleanup()` from @testing-library/react in `afterEach` to avoid duplicate DOM elements between tests

## 2026-01-28 - US-001
- Scaffolded Vite + React + TypeScript project
- Configured Tailwind CSS v4 with @tailwindcss/vite plugin
- Initialized Convex directory with tsconfig
- Set up Vitest with jsdom, @testing-library/react, jest-dom
- Added npm scripts: typecheck, test, test:watch, check
- **Tests added:** 2 new tests in src/App.test.tsx
- **Files changed:** 16 new files (project scaffolding)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Vite scaffolding with `npm create vite@latest` won't overwrite existing files — use a temp dir
  - Package name defaults to template name — remember to update it
  - Tailwind v4 uses `@import "tailwindcss"` instead of v3's `@tailwind` directives
  - Need `afterEach(cleanup)` in tests or DOM elements accumulate across tests
